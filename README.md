Design Pattern Question: Need for Speed: Most Wanted - Scalable Car Customization and Performance
Scenario: In Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005), players collect and utilize various car parts to 
upgrade their vehicles, impacting performance and visual appearance. The system needs to support 
diverse car models, a broad range of upgrade parts, and allow for future expansion with new content.

Design Pattern: Identify and explain the design pattern(s) suitable for implementing the following 
aspects of the car customization and performance system:

	Modular Car Design: The game features multiple car models with distinct handling characteristics. 
	How could a design pattern be used to represent and create new cars while maintaining consistent behavior?

	Upgradable Parts: A variety of upgrade parts (engine, suspension, etc.) affect different performance 
	aspects. What design pattern(s) could be used to represent and manage these parts with their individual 
	effects?

	Performance Scaling: Upgrading parts should offer incremental and cumulative performance improvements. 
	How could a design pattern be used to create a scalable performance system that accommodates various 
	upgrade combinations and future additions?

	Data-Driven Design: The system should be flexible enough to support new car models, parts, and performance 
	tweaks without extensive code changes. What design pattern(s) could facilitate data-driven configuration 
	and updates?

Bonus: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen design patterns in the context of the Need 
for Speed: Most Wanted customization and performance system. Consider scalability, maintainability, and 
potential performance implications.

Additional Challenge: Explain how the design patterns used for the pursuit system (in the previous question) 
could be integrated with the car customization and performance system to create a more dynamic and personalized 
gameplay experience.

This expanded question incorporates scalability and data-driven design considerations, pushing you to think 
about long-term maintainability and future-proofing the game's architecture. Have fun exploring the world of 
design patterns in Need for Speed: Most Wanted!
